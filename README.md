##### - To avoid overcomplicating, we will be only working off the `Master` branch. Do not create branches.
##### - Test changes locally before pushing (Google, Firefox, etc). This will minimise fixes needed on the live site.

Below is the /assets tree structure. Each member will store their media, etc, under their respective student ID directory

##### Reminders:

`git-clone` - **only** perform if you do not have a local copy (first time working on the project) *or* if you delete your local copy.

`git-pull` **every** time you begin your coding session. This ensures you have the most recent changes locally.

`git-commit` **every** time you make a significant change to project / when you finished your coding session.
